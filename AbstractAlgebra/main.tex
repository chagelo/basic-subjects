\subsection{Laws of Composition}


\begin{problem}
	Let $a, b\in S$, assume operation of S is associative, and its identity is $e$. If $a$ is left inverse of $b$, does this imply that $a$ is right inverse of $b$?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose $b$ has left inverse $a$ and right inverse $c$: $ab = e, bc = e$ but $a\neq c$. Then $ae = a = a(bc)=(ab)c=c$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $la=e,ar=e$ (it imply that a has both left and right inverse), then $l=r$.
	\item If $a$ is invertible, its inverse is unique.
	\item Inverse multipy in the opposite order: $(ab)^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1}$
	\item An element $a$ may have a left inverse or a right inverse, though it is not invertible.
\end{enumerate}

The last statement is unique and interesting.

\begin{lemma}
	Every nonzero integer can be written as a product of primes.
\end{lemma}

\marginnote[1cm]{Easy to prove.}
\begin{lemma}
	If $a,b \in \Z$ and $b>0$, there exist $q,r\in \Z$ such that $a=qb+r$ with $0\le r < b$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}%%  [can be kept empty]
	Here's is the beautiful Schr\"odinger equation
	\[ i\hbar {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\Psi (x,t)=
	\left[-{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}}+V(x,t)\right]\Psi (x,t)\]
\end{definition}

\subsection{Groups and Subgroups}

A group is a set $G$ together with a law of composition that has the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item associative, $(ab)c=a(bc)$ for all $a,b,c\in G$
	\item identity element $e$, $ea=ae=a$ for all $a\in G$
	\item for all $a\in G$, $a$ has a inverse $b$, such that $ab=ba=1$
\end{enumerate}

An $abelian group$ is a group whose law of composition is commutative. For example, the set of nonzero real numbers forms an abelian group under multiplication, and the set of all real numbers forms a abelian group under addition.

\begin{proposition}[\textbf{Cancellation Law}]
	Let $a,b,c$ be elements of a group $G$ whose law of composition is written multiplicatively. If $ab=ac$ or if $ba=ca$, then $b=c$. If $ab=a$ or if $ba=a$, then b=1.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Multipy both sides of $ab=ac$ on the left by $a^{-1}$ to obtain $b=c$. The other proofs are analogous. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	Let $\langle x\rangle$ be the cyclic subgroup of a group $G$ generated by an element $x$, and let $S$ denote the set of integers $k$ such that $x^k=1$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The set $S$ is a subgroup of the additive group $\Z^{+}$.
		\item  
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item The $n\times n$ general linear group is the group of all invertible $n\times n$ matrices. It is denoted by $GL_n = {n\times n~\mathrm{invertible matrices A}}$. $GL_n(\mathbb{R}), GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ indicate matrices units are real or complex number. If all matrices of the group have determinant 1, then it's called the special linear group, it's a subgroup of $GL_n$, it's denoted by $SL_n$.
	\item $S_n$ is the group of permutations of $\{1, 2,\cdots,n\}$, sometimes it's called the symmetric group. The symmetric group $S_n$ is a finite group of order $n!$.
\end{enumerate}

The permutations of a set ${a, b}$ of two elements are the identity and the transposition. It's a group of order two. Notice the difference between this set and $S_2$, especially definition of $S_n$.

Every group $G$ has two obvious subgroups: the group $G$ itself, and the trivial subgroup that consists of the identity element alone.

\subsection{Subgroups of the Additive Group of Integers}

Let $a$ be an integer different from 0. We denote the subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ that consists of all multiples of $a$ by $\mathbb{Z}a$: 
\begin{equation}
	\Z a =\{n\in Z\mid n=ka~\text{for some k in } \Z\}.
\end{equation}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $S$ be a subgroup of additive group $\Z^{+} (\mathrm{or}~(\Z, +))$. Either $S$ is the trivial subgroup ${0}$, or else it has the form $\Z a$, where $a$ is the smallest positive integer in $S$.
\end{theorem}

$Za\cap Zb=Zm, m=\mathrm{lcm}(a, b)$, and $Za + Zb=Za\cup Zb=Zn, n = \gcd(a, b)$

\subsection{Cycle Groups}

$\langle x \rangle$ is a cyclic subgroup of a group $G$,
